------------------------------------------------

 * Fixed encryption problem if duplicate certificates are in the
   keybox.

Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.3 (2007-03-08)
------------------------------------------------

 * By default, do not allow processing multiple plaintexts in a single
   stream.  Many programs that called GnuPG were assuming that GnuPG
   did not permit this, and were thus not using the plaintext boundary
   status tags that GnuPG provides.  This change makes GnuPG reject
   such messages by default which makes those programs safe again.
   --allow-multiple-messages returns to the old behavior. [CVE-2007-1263].

 * New --verify-option show-primary-uid-only.

 * Fixed a serious and exploitable bug in processing encrypted
   packages. [CVE-2006-6235].

 * Added --passphrase-repeat to set the number of times GPG will
   prompt for a new passphrase to be repeated.  This is useful to help
   memorize a new passphrase.  The default is 1 repetition.

 * Using a PIN pad does now also work for the signing key.

 * A warning is displayed by gpg-agent if a new passphrase is too
   short.  New option --min-passphrase-len defaults to 8.

 * The status code BEGIN_SIGNING now shows the used hash algorithms.


Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.1 (2006-11-28)
------------------------------------------------

 * Experimental support for the PIN pads of the SPR 532 and the Kaan

   don't want it.  Does currently only work for the OpenPGP card and
   its authentication and decrypt keys.

 * Fixed build problems on some some platforms and crashes on amd64.

   gpg part.  For production use of OpenPGP the gpg version 1.4.5 is
   still recommended.  Note, that gpg will be installed under the name

   straightforward pkcs#15 modules has been written.  As of now it
   does allows only signing using TCOS cards but we are going to
   enhance it to match all the old capabilities.

 * [gpg-agent] New option --write-env-file and Assuan command
   UPDATESTARTUPTTY.

   confirmation.

 * Creating PKCS#10 requests does now honor the key usage.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.8 (2004-04-29)
------------------------------------------------

 * [scdaemon] Overhauled the internal CCID driver.

 * [scdaemon] Status files named ~/.gnupg/reader_<n>.status are now
   written when using the internal CCID driver.

 * [gpgsm] New commands --dump-{,secret,external}-keys to show a very
   detailed view of the certificates.

 * The keybox gets now compressed after 3 hours and ephemeral
   stored certificates are deleted after about a day.

 * [gpg] Usability fixes for --card-edit.  Note, that this has already
   been ported back to gnupg-1.3


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.7 (2004-04-06)
------------------------------------------------

 * Instrumented the modules for gpgconf.

 * Added support for DINSIG card applications.

 * Include the smimeCapabilities attribute with signed messages.

 * Now uses the gettext domain "gnupg2" to avoid conflicts with gnupg
   versions < 1.9.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.6 (2004-03-06)
------------------------------------------------

 * Code cleanups and bug fixes.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.5 (2004-02-21)
------------------------------------------------

 * gpg-protect-tool gets now installed into libexec as it ought to be.
   Cleaned up the build system to better comply with the coding
   standards.

 * [gpgsm] The --import command is now able to autodetect pkcs#12
   files and import secret and private keys from this file format.
   A new command --export-secret-key-p12 is provided to allow
   exporting of secret keys in PKCS\#12 format.

 * [gpgsm] The pinentry will now present a description of the key for
   whom the passphrase is requested.

 * [gpgsm] New option --with-validation to check the validity of key
   while listing it.

 * New option --debug-level={none,basic,advanced,expert,guru} to map
   the debug flags to sensitive levels on a per program base.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.4 (2004-01-30)
------------------------------------------------

 * Added support for the Telesec NKS 2.0 card application.

 * Added simple tool addgnupghome to create .gnupg directories from
   /etc/skel/.gnupg.

 * Various minor bug fixes and cleanups; mainly gpgsm and gpg-agent
   related.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.3 (2003-12-23)
------------------------------------------------

 * New gpgsm options --{enable,disable}-ocsp to validate keys using
   OCSP. This option requires a not yet released DirMngr version.
   Default is disabled.

 * The --log-file option may now be used to print logs to a socket.
   Prefix the socket name with "socket://" to enable this.  This does
   not work on all systems and falls back to stderr if there is a
   problem with the socket.

 * The options --encrypt-to and --no-encrypt-to now work the same in
   gpgsm as in gpg.  Note, they are also used in server mode.

 * Duplicated recipients are now silently removed in gpgsm.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.2 (2003-11-17)
------------------------------------------------

 * On card key generation is no longer done using the --gen-key
   command but from the menu provided by the new --card-edit command.

 * PINs are now properly cached and there are only 2 PINs visible.
   The 3rd PIN (CHV2) is internally syncronized with the regular PIN.

 * All kind of other internal stuff.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.1 (2003-09-06)
------------------------------------------------

 * Support for OpenSC is back. scdaemon supports a --disable-opensc to
   disable OpenSC use at runtime, so that PC/SC or ct-API can still be
   used directly.

 * Rudimentary support for the SCR335 smartcard reader using an
   internal driver.  Requires current libusb from CVS.

 * Bug fixes.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.0 (2003-08-05)
------------------------------------------------

      ====== PLEASE SEE README-alpha =======

 * gpg has been renamed to gpg2 and gpgv to gpgv2.  This is a
   temporary change to allow co-existing with stable gpg versions.

 * ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf-1.9.0 is fist tried as config file before the
   usual gpg.conf.

 * Removed the -k, -kv and -kvv commands.  -k is now an alias to
   --list-keys.  New command -K as alias for --list-secret-keys.

 * Removed --run-as-shm-coprocess feature.

 * gpg does now also use libgcrypt, libgpg-error is required.

 * New gpgsm commands --call-dirmngr and --call-protect-tool.

 * Changing a passphrase is now possible using "gpgsm --passwd"

 * The content-type attribute is now recognized and created.

 * The agent does now reread certain options on receiving a HUP.

 * The pinentry is now forked for each request so that clients with
   different environments are supported.  When running in daemon mode
   and --keep-display is not used the DISPLAY variable is ignored.

 * Merged stuff from the newpg branch and started this new
   development branch.
